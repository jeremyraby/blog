    <h3>March 2022</h3>
    <p>So I'm back to learning web development --- right back to the very beginning.
      I've been struggling for years to #learntocode, but am finally on a bit of a personal
      schedule and timeline for doing so. I plan to use this blog as a journal of sorts to document
      the journey.
